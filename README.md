# PersonInfoApp
**PersonInfoApp** is a WPF application built using the MVVM pattern. It allows you to manage users — add, edit, delete, and view detailed information. The app computes additional properties (such as age, Western zodiac, Chinese zodiac, and birthday status) based on a user’s birth date. It also supports filtering and sorting, and features a Material Design UI powered by MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit.
